mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This instruction can cause an exception if the value of EBX + ECX * 4 is not a valid memory address.  This can happen if:

* ECX is too large, causing an overflow.
* The sum of EBX and ECX*4 is outside the addressable memory space.
* The memory at the calculated address is not accessible (e.g., protected memory).
